Awesome band in shithole divebar! My wife, our friends, and I were sitting near the back waiting for opener to finish up. At some point during Candlebox's opening song, we all kind of stopped chatting and were like 'Is this Candlebox?'. In our defence, it was a newer song we weren't familiar with and they did not look like the 1994 version of Candlebox.
