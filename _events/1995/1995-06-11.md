I smuggled a pack of lady fingers into the show. While leaving the venue, I lit the pack as the heard of concert-goers filed out. Fast forward 15 or so years, I come to find out that this was a co-worker's first concert. I asked about fireworks outside of the doors. She remembered this not as funny as I do/did. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
