This was a mix of stand-up comedy (good) with comedy songs (bad). A few of The Sandman's friends stopped by (Kevin James & Rob Schneider were the only ones I recognized from the hallway) This is one of the only shows that I can recall my wife and I leaving before it was over. We were not the only ones.
