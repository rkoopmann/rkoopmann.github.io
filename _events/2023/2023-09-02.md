After [night 1](/event/2023-08-31), I tried it and got my [handheld camera](https://www.dji.com/pocket-2) through security, though the guy was quite concerned it was an audio recorder or a lazer or something.
After powering on and showing him, he let me pass.
I captured a number of songs, but, honestly, the seats sucked as they were _behind_ the stage.
So it's mostly just their backs and general admission fans.
