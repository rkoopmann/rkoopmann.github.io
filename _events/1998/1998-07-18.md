Two great festivals meet up.

Maynard was in a powdered body paint with a bra, lipstick, and a puffy wig. This was back when he was out in front of the band. Prime Tool.

Walked by Bad Religion's tent and there was Greg Graffin and a couple of the guys in the band were just sitting there grilling hot dogs. I did not say anything because I was too cool for that. smh.
