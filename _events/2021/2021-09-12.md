What an odd mix of artists.
Hoobastank opened the night and pretty quickly got the otherwise empty general admission area filled up with those of us who got assigned seating.
Living Colour was good, but honestly, everyone was just waiting for _Cult of Personality_.
Everclear was good, but Alex was starting to show his age.
