During the first year of graduate school, I was already thinking about what I was going to do for my [master's thesis](../using-the-act-to-predict-college-graduation/). Since I was deep into research & measurement, I thought I'd extend continue a class paper that I had done in my senior year of undergraduate studies.
That turned into this paper.

[Here's a local copy of the paper][local].

Here's the abstract:

> Perceived organizational justice and organizational citizenship behaviors have frequently been studied separately (e.g., Sheppard, Lewick, & Minton, 1992; Skarlicki & Folger, 1997; Allen & Rush, 1998; and Chen, Hui, & Sego 1998), as well as in conjunction with each other (e.g., Ball, Trevino, & Sims 1994; and Moorman 1991). The current review of the literature condenses the findings of these and other studies, working first with perceived justice, then with citizenship behaviors, and ending on the connection between the two areas.

At some point after this issue of the journal was published, one of the cited authors reached out to my advisor suggesting plagiarism, despite his work being cited many times throughout the 9 page paper. Recognizing the ambiguity, I promptly fixed the offending area and notified the journal and which made the update; I believe this is the updated version.
