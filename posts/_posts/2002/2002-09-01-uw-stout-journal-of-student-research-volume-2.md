G. Scott Davis, Brad Griesbach, Jared M. Samuels, and myself took this on as a project for the class _Principles of Program Evaluation 2_ for our Master of Science in a Applied Psychology program.
The thing I remember most on this was that the definition of "binge drinking" felt incredibly conservative.
Ever since, anytime I hear these reports about binge drinking being at concerning levels, I scoff.

We submitted the research to the University of Wisconsin-Stout's Journal of Student Research and it was published in the 2nd volume, but I'm unable to confirm this is a proper citation:

> Davis, G. S., Griesbach, B. J., Koopmann, R., Jr., & Samuels, J. M. (2002). _Alcohol and Other Drug Perceptions Survey._ University of Wisconsin-Stout Journal of Student Research, 2, 93-105.


Anyway, [here's a local copy of the final report][local].
