UW-Stout coordinated immersive, 3-week Summer Technology and Engineering Preview (STEPS) camps for 400-500 7th grade girls across 6 campuses. The purpose of each STEPS camp was to positively impact attendees self-perceptions related to science, math, technology, and engineering.

In order to assess the efficacy of this program, we ran surveys!
