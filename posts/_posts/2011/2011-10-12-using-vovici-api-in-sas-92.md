My submission was accepted for presentation at the [2011 Conference][wuss2011] of [Western Users of SAS Software][wuss] in San Francisco, CA. Not to brag, but this was named **Best Contributed Paper** in its category, so you know it is pretty good.

[Here's a local copy of the paper][local].

Here's the abstract:

> With the release of SAS 9.2, programmers were able to communicate directly with third-party services via two new procedures (depending on the type of service being accessed): the HTTP procedure for Representational State Transfer (REST) Protocol-based services, the SOAP procedure for Simple Object Access (SOA) Protocol-based services. Given these tools, SAS can interact with data on remote servers directly.
>
> The current paper demonstrates how the SOAP procedure is being employed for more automated ETL processes from Vovici, a third-party survey hosting service, using the SOA Protocol. The returned xml-based survey results, when paired with the xml-based survey definition, are used as input for regular reporting processes.
