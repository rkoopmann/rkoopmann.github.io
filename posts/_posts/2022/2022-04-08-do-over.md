_TLDR; I released [my first iOS/macOS App](/do-over/)._

In prior jobs, I wrote a lot of [SAS](https://www.sas.com) code; some even made its way [here](/tag-sas/).
One of the gems I came across was the `%do_over` macro created by Ted Clay and [shared with the SAS community](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/proceedings/sugi31/040-31.pdf) back in 2006<label for="local-copy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="local-copy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="/do-over/040-31.pdf">local copy of Ted Clay's paper</a></span>.
The macros Ted shared streamlined lengthy scripts and made code maintenance considerably easier.

Outside of SAS environment, I frequently found myself wanting to replicate the `%do_over` behavior.
But because such integration wasn't possible at runtime, so I turned to being able to at least replicate the functionality to generate the desired code.
I turned to one off shell scripts. As one does.

For example, I'd switch over to [CodeRunner](https://coderunnerapp.com) and build out something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for m in Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec; do
    echo ", ROUND(SUM(${m}), 2) AS ${m}"
done
```

And then copy the results:

```
, ROUND(SUM(Jan), 2) AS Jan
, ROUND(SUM(Feb), 2) AS Feb
, ROUND(SUM(Mar), 2) AS Mar
, ROUND(SUM(Apr), 2) AS Apr
, ROUND(SUM(May), 2) AS May
, ROUND(SUM(Jun), 2) AS Jun
, ROUND(SUM(Jul), 2) AS Jul
, ROUND(SUM(Aug), 2) AS Aug
, ROUND(SUM(Sep), 2) AS Sep
, ROUND(SUM(Oct), 2) AS Oct
, ROUND(SUM(Nov), 2) AS Nov
, ROUND(SUM(Dec), 2) AS Dec
```

Each time I wanted to change something, I spent time going back into CodeRunner, adjusting and tweaking things, rather than actually _doing_ what I needed to get done.

I also wanted to get into app development as it looked interesting.
I had tried with Objective C back in the heyday of the AppStore, I even bought [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Objective-C-2-0-Stephen-Kochan/dp/0321566157#detailBullets_feature_div) in 2008/2009, but that never clicked with me.
Then Apple announced [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift/) in June 2014, but that also didn't click.
Then Apple released [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) in September 2016, but the tutorials were...meh.
Then Apple announced [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) in June 2019, but that also didn't click (yet).
Eventually, I was able to cobble together a functioning SwiftUI app built entirely in Swift Playgrounds on iPad.
If I recall, I submitted the app to App Review directly from my iPad.
What a time to be alive.
