_TLDR; I released [my second iOS App](/card-piles/)._

Back in junior high school, my friend taught me a simple card trick:

1. Deal out 21 cards in 3 rows of 7 cards each.
2. Ask the person to remember their card and point to the row holding it.
3. Collect rows.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 two times.
5. Flip over cards until just before you arrive at their card.
6. Amaze them by having them flip over their own card.

Underneath this trick is simple [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_Card_Trick).

I thought it'd be a fun little challenge to make an app to replicate the majority of the trick.

It's got options for performing the trick with 15, 21, 27, 35, 45, 55, & 65 cards; the same process is at play, so really, the physical size of the device defines the upper limit of what's usable.

Because I'm slightly lazy, I copied the same three view organization from [do-over](/do-over/) -- Main view, About view, & Settings view.
