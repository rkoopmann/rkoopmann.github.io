Last month, Ben Brooks ran [a poll on his website][the-poll] asking readers their attitudes toward interrupting other people using various writing devices. I reached out to Ben and he provided with me the poll data for analysis.

With my initial, and somewhat hasty, pass through the data, I sent the results back to Ben, which he [posted][the-results].

The thing is, in my haste, I goofed a bit. I had originally ran chi square tests and identified the cells with the largest deviation as being "significantly different". [Max Masnick](http://maxmasnick.com), an epidemiology PhD student, correctly pointed out that a chi square test only identifies that *something* is different; it does not identify *what* is different. For that, you need some additional testing.

I recently went back, revisited the data, and updated my analysis. And Ben kindly posted [that update][updated-results].
