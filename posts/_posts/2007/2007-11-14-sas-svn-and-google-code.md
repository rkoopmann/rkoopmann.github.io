i'll admit it. when i first started this project (all of three weeks ago?), i was a little confused with the [svn files](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206021101/http://sas-quatch.googlecode.com/svn/) not showing up on the [downloads page](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206021101/http://code.google.com/p/sas-quatch/downloads/list). that's why i gave up on svn. then i realized that the svn is for development purposes whereas the downloads should be reserved for stable releases. so it makes sense that these need to be uploaded individually.

i did mess up one thing, though. i should have made a subdirectory called itunes to store itunes-related stuff. someday soon, i'll probably correct this. maybe. i'm still getting the svn inner workings figured out in my head.
