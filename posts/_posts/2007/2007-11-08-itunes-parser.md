summary: wherein i coerce sas into consuming the iTunes library xml file.

today, i published [`itunes.sas`](/assets/sas/itunes.sas), an itunes xml library parser and [`itunes_analyzer.sas`](/assets/sas/itunes_analyzer.sas) to the [defunct] quatch project.

the `iTunes Music Library.xml` is a very odd beast. rather than storing song information like this: `Song Title` apple chose to do it the more painful way: `TitleSong Title`

my motivation for writing this was pretty simple: to figure out which albums have on my ipod that i don't listen to often enough to justify the hdd space they occupy. once identified, i can simply uncheck them and sync up. i can tell you right now, i don't think queensryche's _empire_ is going to make the cutâ€¦
