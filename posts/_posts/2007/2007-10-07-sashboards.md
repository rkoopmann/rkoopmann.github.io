thank you, sas! you finally put up some [great examples](http://support.sas.com/rnd/datavisualization/dashboards/) on how to create dashboards with nothing more than sas/graph. i'm paging between two of [stephen few](http://www.b-eye-network.com/authors/index.php?a=79)'s books: [show me the numbers](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Numbers-Designing-Enlighten/dp/0970601999/ref=pd_rhf_f_2/103-2729875-4252647) and [information dashboard design](http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/ref=pd_rhf_f_1/103-2729875-4252647). i'd categorize few as an applied version of [tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com), who can often be more theoretical than practical.

i'm dissecting the [telesales](http://support.sas.com/ctx/samples/index.jsp?sid=1699&tab=output) and [marketing analysis](http://support.sas.com/ctx/samples/index.jsp?sid=1700&tab=output) dashboardsâ€¦and finding a few new approaches to constructing more usable graphs. good times.
