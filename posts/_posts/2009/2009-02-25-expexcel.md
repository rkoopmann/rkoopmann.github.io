iâ€™ve uploaded the [expExcel macro](https://github.com/rkoopmann/sas-quatch/blob/master/google-code-files/expexcel.sas) to the downloads section of the sas-quatch project [github repository](https://github.com/rkoopmann/sas-quatch). pretty straight forward utility macro. this is a streamlined version that should work on any SAS client with the sas/access to pc files module. at work, that module is only installed on the server, so there is a bit of client-server code that i cut out. if people want to see the client-server version, i can upload that as well.
