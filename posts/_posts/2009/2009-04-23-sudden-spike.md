a couple weeks ago, [@swaynette](http://twitter.com/swaynette) asked me if she could mention my post on [scraping sas training pages](/sas/2009/01/scraping-training-pages) in the [sas tech report for april](http://www.sas.com/news/newsletter/tech/2009_4.html).

what? are you kidding me?! yes! by all means. please do.

a little over a week later, i thought it might be time to check out the effect on site visits, courtesy of google analytics.

![results](/assets/img/2009-04-23-a-sudden-spike.png)

the [quatch blog](/) got a lot more traffic than before. there are currently 18 subscribers (17 not counting me) in google reader, and to date, there have been 221 downloads of the scraping code from the [quatch project](http://github.com/rkoopmann/sas-quatch) page.

weâ€™ll see how many of you stick around for the really good stuff...
