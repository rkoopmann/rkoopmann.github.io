  date: 2022-01-04
  artist: Faith No More
  album: Angel Dust
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/angel-dust/184672979
  year: 1992
  notes: I was familiar with a few tracks via the This Is It album that I already enjoy.
-
  date: 2022-01-04
  artist: Jawbox
  album: For Your Own Special Sweetheart
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-your-own-special-sweetheart/338873219
  year: 1994
  notes: Nothing really. It was music. Mediocre.
-
  date: 2022-01-04
  artist: Government Issue
  album: Legless Bull
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/legless-bull/54532572
  year: 1981
  notes: Sounds like an early 80s punk album would sound like. Fast tempo, short songs, repeating choruses.
-
  date: 2022-01-04
  artist: J. Robbins
  album: Un-Becoming
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/un-becoming/1457353109
  year: 2019
  notes: This album sounds like an alt-pop album circa 1996 that I would not have liked in 1996. Fuck the Future, LLC, nice.
-
  date: 2022-01-11
  artist: Mother Love Bone
  album: Apple
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple/1440655529
  year: 1990
  notes: Dripping with late 80s glam rock sounds. It's almost painful to listen to 31 years later. This is how music sounded in the midwest before Nevermind was released about 14 months later (and subsequently broke into the mainstream and changed music). I recently watched the Pearl Jam 20 documentary and I do believe Ed picked the best Mother Love Bone song (at least on this album) to cover.
-

  artist: Pixies
  album: Come On Pilgrim
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-on-pilgrim/266192033

  artist: Scream
  album: Still Screaming
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-screaming/784885167

  notes: A bit too thrashy for me? not enough melodies, i guess?
-

  artist: All
  album: Allroy Sez…
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/allroy-sez/117332958
  year: 1989

-
  date: 2022-01-14
  artist: Faith No More
  album: King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/king-for-a-day-fool-for-a-lifetime/184673815
  year: 1995
  notes: Again, I was already familiar with a couple of these tracks; I vividly recall picking up the [April 1995 _Concrete Corner_ cassette](https://www.discogs.com/release/19273849-Various-Concrete-Music-Bloc-Volume-IV) from Ernie November's in Mankato, MN and almost wearing out Digging the Grave after attending their show the following month.

  artist: Samiam
  album: Samiam
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/samiam/585953464
  year: 1989
  notes: Big fan of Soar & Clumsy. I can certainly hear the seeds of those tunes here.
-
  date: 2022-01-21
  artist: Veruca Salt
  album: Ghost Notes
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/ghost-notes/992287467
  year: 2015
  notes: It sounds like Veruca Salt's Sea Change album? Lots of break-up lines across many tracks. It's fine; nothing special.
-

  artist: Faces
  album: Ooh La La
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/ooh-la-la/1031010809

  artist: The Beach Boys
  album: Pet Sounds
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/pet-sounds/1440841241

  notes: _Sloop John B_ is quite catchy. Still, this is not my thing.
-

  artist: CIV
  album: B-Sides and Extras
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/b-sides-and-extras/1603642792

  album: CMFB …Sides
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/cmfb-sides/1607366371
  year: 2022

  artist: The Replacements
  album: Let It Be
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-be/162563989
  year: 1984
  notes: "I had only heard Androgynous from The Crash Test Dummies but then The Flaming Lips played it at a show I recently attended. I figured I should probably listen to something from them. Some songs that I found quaint: Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out, Gary's Got a Boner, & Answering Machine."
-
  date: 2022-05-09
  artist: The Rolling Stones
  album: "The Rolling Stones Singles Collection: The London Years"
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rolling-stones-singles-collection-the-london-years/1440759277

  artist: Arcade Fire
  album: WE
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/we/1613566080

-
  date: 2022-05-13
  artist: Hüsker Dü
  album: Metal Circus
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/metal-circus/515536188
  year: 1983
  notes: In the early 1990s, I noticed my older sister's boyfriend wore a Hüsker Dü shirt; Based on the umlauts, I assumed they were German, and not band from St. Paul, MN. While reviewing The Replacements - Let It Be, Hüsker Dü came up in the "Similar Artists" section and it occurred to me that I'd never listened to them before. Not bad, not bad.
-
  date: 2022-05-19

  album: Repeater & 3 Songs
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/repeater-3-songs/49249888

  artist: Dinosaur Jr.
  album: Green Mind
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/green-mind/1318697584
  year: 1991
  notes: This could be background for a movie that's based in the early 1990s. Very unmemorable.
-
  date: 2022-06-01
  artist: The Flaming Lips
  album: Telepathic Surgery
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/telepathic-surgery/332172073
  year: 1989
  notes: I love the flaming lips. but somehow i'd never listened to this album despite having added it to my itunes collection back in 2010. Either that or my scrubbling is/was borked. at any rate, a decent, early version of the flaming lips here.
-
  date: 2022-06-27
  artist: Sonic Youth
  album: Rather Ripped
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/rather-ripped/1443129175

  artist: Goldfinger
  album: Never Look Back
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-look-back/1539569967

-
  date: 2022-07-07
  artist: Helmet
  album: Betty
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/betty/1440903175
  year: 1994
  notes: Milquetoast was on heavy rotation when this came out and I liked it, but never actually bought the album despite my friends praising it. It's a fine album.
-

  artist: Pixies
  album: Doolittle
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/doolittle/7060469
  year: 1989
  notes: I like _Here comes your man_, so figured i'd try this one as well. And I'm now recognizing the _Monkey gone to heaven_ nod in The Bloodhound Gang's 1996 breakout song _Fire water burn_.

  album: Lockjaw
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/lockjaw/1444195087
  year: 1995
  notes: i also apparently saw them open up for bad religion back in April 1996. i don't remember them at all. i hope i won't remember them after listening to this album. it's really not good.

  year: 1996

  album: Doggerel
  url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/doggerel/1626175011

I am ware of this. At the end of 2021, I thought it'd be a fun thing to listen to a new album for each week of the year. I set out to only listen to _old_ albums that for whatever reason, I had never listened to before. [don't judge](https://xkcd.com/1053).

While I didn't hit the goal of one album per week, I got to 50, and that's a win in my book. Also, I cheated a bit and threw in some legitimate _new_ albums as they became available and assuming I remembered to document the listen.

Here's the listing by album release year.

{% assign albums_by_year = page.albums | sort: "year" | group_by_exp: "album", "album.year" %}
{% for year in albums_by_year %}
<tt><strong>{{ year.name }}</strong></tt>
  {% for album in year.items %}
  <div class="index-item"><span class="post-meta"><em><a class="post-link" href="{{ album.url }}">{{ album.album }}</a></em></span>, {{ album.artist }}<br>{{ album.date }}&mdash;{{ album.notes | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}</div>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
