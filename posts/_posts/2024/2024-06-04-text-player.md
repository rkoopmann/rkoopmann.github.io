_TLDR; I released yet another [app][]._

While attending various high school sporting events where my kids were playing (sans phone), I wanted to be able to ask them simple questions without screaming out, "Do you need water?", for example.

I could possibly bring up a new Note, but that clutters things up. And the messages would need to be incredibly terse..."Water?"

Super simple to use:

Step 1: Type out a message

![](/assets/img/2024-06-04-message.png)

Step 2: Turn device to landscape

![](/assets/img/2024-06-04-text-player.mov)

Step 3: Tacos!

So go pick up some tacos and the [app][]!

[app]: /text-player/
