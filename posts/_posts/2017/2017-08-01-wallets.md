I've gone through a number of wallets over the years.

- a studded Fossil wallet/money clip with a peace sign sewed into it.
- a TGT wallet backed on Kickstarter.
- some passport-link wallet recommend by Ben Brooks.
- a wallet made from recycled fire hoses backed on Kickstarter.
- HD wallet made from 2 metal plates and a rubber band backed on Kickstarter.
- Trayvax Elemental.
- Trayvax Contour.
