This was [my][paper] [Master's Thesis][hub] ([local copy][local]).

Here's the abstract; it's as thrilling as it sounds:

> The current study constructs six binary logistic regression models: two sets of models using either (1) high school class size and percentile ranking, and four ACT Test scores (English, Mathematics, Science, and Reading), or (2) high school class size and percentile ranking, and ACT Composite score. For each set, the event was defined at graduating within four, five, or six, years of matriculating into the university. Then, ability of the six models to predict graduation within the specified timeframe is assessed.
