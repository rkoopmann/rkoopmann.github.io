# Inspiration

I wanted to play a simple app to calculate an arbitrary value in terms of point-in-time purchasing power and real value. I also wanted a simple visualization of these calculation over time.

# Privacy

**Data Collection**

Given the above point, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot share data. [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.
