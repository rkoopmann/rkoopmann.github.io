# Terms

Feel free to use [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] at your leisure for whatever purpose you have in mind.

**Refunds**

All [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] purchases are final. I cannot issue refunds charged to your Apple ID, but you can ask [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223) to do so.


# Privacy

**Data Collection**

[{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not collect _any_ data.

**Data Sharing**

Given the above point, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot share data. [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

**Data Retention**

Since [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not collect data, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot retain data.

**Data Loss**

[{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not have the ability to write to your calendars, so don't come crying to me about lost data.
