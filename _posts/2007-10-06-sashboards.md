thank you, sas! you finally put up some [great examples][1] on how to create dashboards with nothing more than sas/graph. i'm paging between two of [stephen few][2]'s books: [show me the numbers][3] and [information dashboard design][4]. i'd categorize few as an applied version of [tufte][5], who can often be more theoretical than practical.

i'm dissecting the [telesales][6] and [marketing analysis][7] dashboardsâ€¦and finding a few new approaches to constructing more usable graphs. good times.
