My submission was accepted for presentation at the [2009 conference][sgf2009] of SAS Global Forum in National Harbor, MD.

[Here's a local copy of the paper][local].

Here's the abstract:

> %LibDoc is a simple macro that produces an Excel workbook containing meta data for a given library. The metadata is pulled from dictionary.* tables via proc sql. The macro is also implemented as a SAS Explorer Action.
>
> Code was developed with SAS 9.1.3 SP4 and HTML Help Workshop 4.74 running under Windows XP Professional.
