two things:

1. mitt's household paid in $3,200,000 in taxes for their 2011 income of $21,000,000.
2. the average median household income for 2009 & 2010 for the US was $50,022.

doing the rough math, Mitt (+ family) could easily support 64 "median" households with what they pay in taxes alone.

Mitt's not like you.
