I was *invited* to submit a paper to the Western Users of SAS Software 
conference this September. [Here it is](https://github.com/rkoopmann/build-and-track-sas-macros/blob/master/WUSS%202012-164.pdf?raw=true).

Here is an excerpt from the abstract:

> Many of the routine tasks we do in SAS can be converted into parameterized macros. Whether you are pulling standard data sets for ad hoc reports or some other low-level functionality, macros can help make repetitious tasks more palatable. Developing a common macro script structure and committing to it are just the first steps toward having a more concise code base.

> This paper outlines framework for developing component macros that report back macro usage. While the framework was developed in a SAS 9.1/9.2 client-server environment (running under Windows XP, 32-bit), it should work under any client-server environment and could be modified to run under disparate clients sharing a common networked drive.

The code is over on [GitHub](https://github.com/rkoopmann/build-and-track-sas-macros) and the full submission can be read [here](https://github.com/rkoopmann/build-and-track-sas-macros/blob/master/WUSS%s02012-164.pdf?raw=true).
