> ### A SAS Macro and jQuery: A System for Examining Data Sets in the Browser ###
> 
> This paper discusses a SAS macro which was developed to quickly examine an arbitrary data set or library. The macro merges the results from `PROC CONTENTS`, `PROC SUMMARY`, and numerous `PROC FREQ` steps into a single data set. In addition to data set-level analysis, the macro also compiles cross-section analysis.
> 
> The results are then written to a `.json` file which is picked up by a custom-built visualization tool. This tool is powered by jQuery and uses open-source plugins (such as jqPlot and jquery-option-tree). Give the flexibility of JSON models, adding visualizations is a straightforward process.

Unfortunately, there was no place to add screenshots in the submission to showcase the working version. Fortunately, I can add a couple here:
