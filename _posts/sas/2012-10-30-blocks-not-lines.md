Debugging SAS macros can be irksome. But Paul D Sherman's paper [*SAS/MACROÂ® NOTES: Lines and Columns in the Log*](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2007/PO26.pdf) certainly helps clarify what the SAS Log is refering to.

> Unlike open code, where LINE refers to the actual line of source code, the macro "line" is actually a block of statements.
