About six months ago, Tweetbot came to my attention--probably via the [B&B Podcast](http://5by5.tv/bb) (though i'm not sure which B it was). Tweetbot was a breath of fresh air from the official Twitter client.

It has a number of very powerful differentiators:

- able to view a conversation thread with a simple right-to-left swipe.
- able to view replies to a tweet with a left-to-right swipe.
- able to switch between your timeline with your lists.

at any rate, Tweetbot is currently on sale for [$1](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8{{site.affiliateid}}) (regularly $2.99). At either price, it's a great investment.
