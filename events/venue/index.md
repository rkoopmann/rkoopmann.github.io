# Venues

## Repeats

{% assign topVenues = site.data.events.list-venues | where_exp: "e", "e.show.size >= 2" %}

{{ topVenues | size }} of the venues are repeats: {% for e in topVenues %}_[{{ e.venue }}](/event/venue/{{ e.venue | slugify }})_ ({{ e.show | size }}Ã—){% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}{% endfor %}

## Full Listing

Here's the complete listing of venues which I had tickets to attend; Despite my original ticket purchase, I did not attend those formatted as <s>strikethrough</s> for some reason; typically cancelled or postponed events or the artist I was most interested in seeing backed out (I'm looking at you, [Beck](/event/2022-11-13/)).

{% assign items_grouped = site.data.event-venues | group_by_exp: "item", "item.venue | slice: 0, 1 | upcase" | sort: "name" %}
{% for g in items_grouped %}
<tt><strong>{{ g.name }}</strong></tt>
  {% assign items = g.items %}
  {% for item in items %}
  <div class="index-item"><span class="post-meta"><tt><a class="post-link" href="/event/venue/{{ item.venue | slugify }}">{{ item.venue }}</a></tt></span></div>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
