# Artists

## Repeats

Some artists are repeats: {% for e in topArtists %}_[{{ e.artist }}](/event/artist/{{ e.artist | slugify }})_ ({{ e.events.size }}Ã—){% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}{% endfor %}


## Full Listing

Here's the complete listing of artists which I had tickets to attend; Despite my original ticket purchase, I did not attend those formatted as <s>strikethrough</s> for some reason; typically cancelled or postponed events or the artist I was most interested in seeing backed out (I'm looking at you, [Beck](/event/2022-11-13/)).


{% assign items_grouped = site.data.event-artists | group_by_exp: "item", "item.artist | slice: 0, 1 | upcase" %}
{% for g in items_grouped %}
<tt><strong>{{ g.name }}</strong></tt>
  {% assign items = g.items %}
  {% for item in items %}
  <div class="index-item"><span class="post-meta"><tt><a class="post-link" href="/event/artist/{{ item.artist | slugify }}">{{ item.artist }}</a></tt></span></div>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
