Like most people, I use a calendar at work. Like some people, I get to track my time (yay!). I've come into the habit of simply tracking my time on a dedicated calendar.

There's a lot of benefits in doing this. I'm already accustomed to the interface (my calendar app), the data is backed up, thanks to iCloud, calendars are supported practically anywhere, etc.

Getting data in is easy. Manipulating data is easy, but very much a one-at-a-time thing. Getting data out, that's the tricky bit and that's where this cli app and [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org).

The app is currently [free and open source][repo].

# Support

This app shouldn't break your calendar or computer, but you're on your own. If you think you've found a bug, please [open an issue][issues].
