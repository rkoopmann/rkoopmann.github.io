I've been playing sheepshead at family holidays for the better part of 25 years. When I was first learning how to play, everything I found had slightly different styles...everything from 3-handed to 5-handed, sometimes using the 8s and 7s and sometimes not, occasionally with some random exception about how doubles can occur, when you can and cannot call a partner etc.

I never found a version based on what I knew how to play: 4-handed sheepshead using 24 cards (Queens, Jacks, Aces, Tens, Kings, & Nines). Now I have that version, and [you can too][appstore].

# Privacy

**Data Collection**

[{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] collects your played game data for the sole purpose of showing you statistics. These data are stored in your iCloud account for convenience. These data are not transmitted in any way to third-parties; It's just you & GameCenter.

**Data Sharing**

Given the above point, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot share data. [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

**Data Retention**

Since [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does collect data, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] also allows you to remove this data; In the Statistics view, tap the Game History button. At the bottom of the listing, there's a Clear History button that will irrevocably purge this data from your device and iCloud account.
