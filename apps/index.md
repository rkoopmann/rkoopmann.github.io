For the past 10 years or so, I've wanted to get into iOS programming; that never really happened. But recently, I've been releasing some apps:
- [flation](/flation/) provides an historical view of US monetary values over time.
- [card piles](/card-piles/) is a mobile version of the 21 card trick.
- [do over](/do-over/) provides useful text permutations and is generally of interest to programmer-types.
