- [epochs](/app/epochs) surfaces temporal differences among disjointed events and may be of interest to those of us who enjoy saying things like "Nirvana's _Nevermind_ ([1991-09-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind)) is closer to The Beatles first gig ([1960-08-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_timeline)) than it is to today."
- [do over](/app/do-over) provides useful text permutations and is generally of interest to programmer-types.
