For the past 10 years or so, I've wanted to get into iOS programming; that never really happened. But today, I've release my first iPhone/iPad/Apple Silicon app -- [do over â€” text permutations](https://do-over.app) ([buy it!][app link]).

I hope to share more about this app and my slow foray into in App Store. Lots of things came together to get this simple utility out to the world.
