## Shortcuts Support

Version 1.4 introduces two Shortcuts.app actions:

- Permutate Text - runs the basic permutations. helper functions (e.g., \days, \help, \1-5) are not available in this action.
- Resolve Range - resolves ranges (e.g., -10--4, 1-5).

As with most things in Shortcuts.app, you can feed output from one action as a parameter into another action. For example, [this](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2dcec0a841ca49e68a44da686414ffbb) shortcut:
