_do over_ is organized into the following sections:

- **Values** is the place to enter your variables. The adjacent settings button lets you make changes to these raw values.
- **Result** shows the resulting permutation. The adjacent settings button lets you take actions on the result, including pipine back into the **Values** section.
- **Settings** is the place to make adjustments to underlying permutation settings.
    - _Values_ allows you to specify the value list delimiter to use. The adjacent settings button allows you to quickly clear the delimiter (Using an empty value delimiter will split the Values at each character) and, if you're on iOS, offer to insert the tab character in the delimiter field.
    - _Template_ is where you specify the pattern to riff on and what token the pattern represents where the value item goes. The adjacent settings button offers some quick actions as well as inserting the flags for changing casings.
    - _Result_ is where you specify the permutation join string. The adjacent settings button offers some quick actions.
- **About**
    - _Help_ offers some helpful things.
    - _Miscellaneous Debris_ is my nod to Primus and some self-serving links.
    - _Do Over_ offers some user actions and technical information related to the app.
