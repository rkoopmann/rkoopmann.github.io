# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

[do over][] does not collect _any_ data.

## Data Sharing

Given the above point, [do over][] cannot share data. [do over][] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

## Data Retention

Since [do over][] does not collect data, [do over][] cannot retain data.
