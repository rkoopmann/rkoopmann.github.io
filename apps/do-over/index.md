- Want to quickly create some similar text without manually typing everything out? do over can do that.
- Want to quickly and easily change the values and see the results in realtime? do over can do that.
- Want to use a different placeholder in the template? do over can do that.
- Want to see how the merged results will look using different joins? do over can do that.
- Want to be successful in life? do over, unfortunately, cannot do that.
- Want to unknowingly share your data with who-knows-who? do over [can't help you with that](./privacy/).

Provide a list of values (`apple banana coconut … zucchini`, for example) along with a template to use (such as `?i. ?`), and do over generates merged output:

    1. apple
    2. banana
    3. coconut
    …
    26. zucchini
