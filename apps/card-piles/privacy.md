# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

[card piles][] does not collect _any_ data.

## Data Sharing

Given the above point, [card piles][] cannot share data. [card piles][] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

## Data Retention

Since [card piles][] does not collect data, [card piles][] cannot retain data.
