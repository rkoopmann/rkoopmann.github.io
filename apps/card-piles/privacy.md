# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

[app][{{ app.name }}] does not collect _any_ data.

## Data Sharing

Given the above point, [app][{{ app.name }}] cannot share data. [app][{{ app.name }}] is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

## Data Retention

Since [app][{{ app.name }}] does not collect data, [app][{{ app.name }}] cannot retain data.
