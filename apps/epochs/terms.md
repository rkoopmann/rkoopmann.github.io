# Terms of Use

Feel free to use epochs (the "App") at your leisure for whatever purpose you have in mind.

## Subscription

If you choose to subscribe to the premium tier, payment will be charged to your Apple ID account upon purchase confirmation. The subscription will automatically renew unless it is cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period. You can manage your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings.

All purchases are final. I cannot issue refunds charged to your Apple ID.


The App does not have the ability to write to your calendars, so don't come crying to me about lost data.
