# Inspiration & Motivation

In listening to various podcasts featuring Merlin, while all hosts and guests were in focused discussion of the topic at hand, Merlin pepper in quips similar to the following as he drove home his completely on-topic point. (all quips as of 2023-06-20)

> Dr. Emmett Brown was younger when _Back to the Future_ was released (46y 8m 11d) than Marty McFly is now (62y 0m 11d).

&nbsp;

> Nirvana's _Nevermind_ was released closer to The Beatles' first gig (31y 1m 7d) than it is to today (31y 8m 27d).

&nbsp;

> John F. Kennedy's 1961 inauguration was closer to Theodore Roosevelt's 1901 inauguration (59y 4m 6d) than it was to Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration (60y 0m 0d).

I thought it would be fun to have an app help people to come up with similar quips.

# Privacy

**Data Collection**

[{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not collect _any_ data.

**Data Sharing**

Given the above point, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot share data.

These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

Since [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not collect data, [{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] cannot retain data.

**Data Loss**

[{{ page.app.name }}][appstore] does not have the ability to write to your calendars, so don't come crying to me about lost data.
