# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

_epochs_ does not collect _any_ data.

## Data Sharing

Given the above point, _epochs_ cannot share data. _epochs_ is a SwiftUI app and makes use of Apple's developer libraries exclusively; no external libraries. These Apple libraries do not, to the best of my knowledge, collect data.

## Data Retention

Since _epochs_ does not collect data, _epochs_ cannot retain data.
