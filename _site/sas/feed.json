I wanted to give Vespre a fair chance, but without being able to import from my existing note-taking app (Simplenote), Vesper had an uphill battle. (Same goes for Drafts).On OS X, Simplenote prefers to store notes in a SQLite database, so I figured Simplenote for iOS would do the same. I figured Vesper would be doing likewise. A quick check with iExplorer confirmed this.I exported a copy of both databases and quickly created some basic SQL queries to get notes, unique tags, and note-tag combination data in reasonable format for exporting from Simplenote database and importing into Vesper database. (At this point, I force-quit Vesper on iOS.)Creating these queries was quick work in SQLPro for SQLite. To actually transfer the content to the Vesper database, I simply exported the resulting tables from the Simplenote database as JSON files and then imported them in the Vesper database in this order:  Notes  Tags  Note-Tag relationsOnce that’s done, copy the modified Vesper database back to the Vesper Documents directory in iExplorer (it should ask about overwriting the existing file), say yes, wait a few seconds for iExplorer to complete the sync, fire up Vesper (you already force-quit it above, right?) and look at all the Simplenote data. They should all be properly tagged and the dates intact. I think.If only there were a Vesper for OS X available, this would possibly have been easier?Let’s see how well Vesper sticks for me now that everything is in it.Apps Used:  Vesper (iOS) $8.  Simplenote (iOS) $0. Notational Velocity or nvALT on OS X would probably also have the information needed, but you’d need to wrangle that data yourself.  iExplorer (OS X). For pulling and pushing data to your iOS device. I used version 2.2.1.6. v. 3.6.6.0 might work?  SQLPro for SQLite Pro (OS X). At one point, this was $2; it’s now $20. If you’re cozy with tromping around the terminal with SQLite, you don’t really need an SQLite app. I’m cozy enough, but still prefer to use the app.Fair Warning: You should never, ever run code you don’t understand.

I checked store.apple.com, same price. To be sure I wasn’t seeing things, I checked the Apple Store app again; still $329.Now I don’t really need a new iPad mini, but for the same starting price as the original iPad was upon launch ($70 off), I could more easily be convinced.This had to be a mistake, right? Only, what if it wasn’t?I called up Apple and got through to the sales department. Talked to a nice enough guy who saw the same $329 starting price on his iPhone. I asked how I can order one at that price since every attempt to do so led to a page with a $399 starting price. He put me on hold to talk things over with his manager. 5 minutes later he returned.It was a mistake.Hopeful, I asked if i could still get one at the $329 price.
