      <h1>the $329 retina iPad mini with Retina display</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 28, 2014</p>

<p>Last night, the Apple store was down for something or other. This morning, I hit the Apple Store app on my iPhone to see what might have changed. It seemed like nothing until I noticed the prices on the Featured section.</p>

<p>Except not. Whenever I clicked through to the iPad mini with Retina page, the starting price came up as $399. I checked <a href="">store.apple.com</a>, same price. To be sure I wasn’t seeing things, I checked the Apple Store app again; still $329.</p>

<p>Now I don’t really need a new iPad mini, but for the same starting price as the original iPad was upon launch ($70 off), I could more easily be convinced.</p>

<p>This <em>had</em> to be a mistake, right? Only, what if it wasn’t?</p>

<p>I called up Apple and got through to the sales department. Talked to a nice enough guy who saw the same $329 starting price on his iPhone. I asked how I can order one at that price since every attempt to do so led to a page with a $399 starting price. He put me on hold to talk things over with his manager. 5 minutes later he returned.</p>

<p>It was a mistake.</p>

<p>Hopeful, I asked if i could still get one at the $329 price. He said that, unfortunately, the Apple Legal department does not allow them to honor mistakes in advertising.</p>

<p>Nuts.</p>

<p>It did take a few hours, but the mistake was eventually corrected.</p>
