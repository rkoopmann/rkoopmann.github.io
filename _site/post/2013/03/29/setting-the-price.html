      <h1>setting the price early</h1>
<p class="subtitle">March 29, 2013</p>

<p>Late last October, Apple announced the long-speculated iPad Mini starting at 329 US$ – a price well above the $249 mark many people had hoped for. I was out. There was no way I was going to buy one at that price. Especially without a retina display.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My reaction was something like</p>

<p><em>pfft…$329 is too much. I’m not getting one, my (7 month old) new iPad (3rd gen) is working just fine.</em></p>

<p>After the pricing chatter died down, the early hands-on reviews started coming in, I began reconsidering my no-retina=no-ipad-mini thought process.</p>

<p>While the resolution is the same as the non-retina iPads, the display size is considerably smaller. The ppi is greater: 132 for non-retina iPads, 264 for retina iPads, and 163 for the iPad Mini.</p>

<p>Directly related, the smaller form factor was no small differentiator. Often, the full-sized iPad felt a little too big for my taste. I’m certain this feeling was amplified in the weeks leading up to, and immediately following the iPad Mini announcement.</p>

<p>If Apple follows their past behavior on iOS devices, the original iPad Mini will be available for $229 in a few short months. At that price, the iPad Mini should start gaining significant traction with less-devoted Apple consumers. i’d expect a lot of Minis under the trees this year.</p>
