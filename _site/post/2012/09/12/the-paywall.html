<p class="subtitle">September 12, 2012</p>

<p>Personally, I like Ben Brooks’ writing style–both <a href="http://brooksreview.net/">long form</a>  and even though Ben is pulling the plug on his <a href="http://twitter.com/benjaminbrooks/">short form</a>–and I thoroughly enjoy his <a href="http://thebbpodcast.com/">weekly conversations</a> with fellow tech writer <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-paywall">The Paywall</h2>

<p>Recently, Ben put up what I’ll call a <em>porous</em> paywall on his site, <a href="http://brooksreview.net"><em>The Brooks Report</em></a>. It’s porous in the sense that members can link to new content for non-members to view directly. Non-members cannot browse the new posts until one week after they are published at which time everyone can see posts.</p>

<p>Some in the tech blogosphere had doubts this model would work (e.g., Marco, The Beard), but its been a few months since the change and all seems to be going well enough.</p>

<p>At first, I wasn’t going to sign up, but the effect of seeing someone whose opinion I respect apparently reporting on last week’s events this week was just enough to push me over to the members side of things. Since I like Ben’s style, I signed up without much thought–That wasn’t true at the time of my discovery, but it is now.</p>

<aside>Let me preface this post by saying I (tend to) prefer to pay for an app or service that I use and like even when the same app or service is offered at no charge (simplenote, instapaper, flickr) or when free alternative apps or services are available (twitter &lt; app.net, delicious &lt; pinboard.in).</aside>

<p>Fellow followers of the twitter and app.net accounts for <em>The Brooks Review</em> may notice that the links are all under the domain <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://tbr.mx</code> which uses the URL-shortener bitly behind the scenes.</p>

<h2 id="the-backdoorrss">The Backdoor.rss</h2>

<p>Recently, I needed to shorten a GitHub project URL so I jumped over to my bitly account. That was when I noticed that bitly shows URLs that others in your <a href="https://bitly.com/a/network">bit.ly network</a> have recently created.</p>

<p>Wait. A bit.ly network? Makes sense, I guess. Everyone is going social, so why not socialize (not <em>that</em> socialize) a URL tracking site, right?</p>

<p>Back to the point, in my bit.ly network is one <a href="http://bitly.com/u/thebr">thebr</a> account held by Ben Brooks that tweets out a link whenever a new post hits his website. And as I found out, converting a bit.ly user page into an RSS feed is as simple as appending <code class="highlighter-rouge">.rss</code> to the end of the URL.</p>

<p>Once we have an RSS feed, two big holes in Ben’s porous paywall open up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone can easily add the feed to their favorite RSS reader</li>
  <li>anyone can use ifttt to do god-knows-what with it</li>
</ul>

<p>So I created two ifttt recipes: one that appends to a Dropbox file and another that downloads the RSS item to HTML. Both are functional, but are limited by the bit.ly redirect.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>This is all possible because of twitter and bitly’s defaulting accounts (and thus their new links) to be public.</p>

<p>At some point in the past, I had connected my bitly account with my twitter account; Ben Brooks did the same with his accounts. Because I follow Ben Brooks’ twitter accounts on twitter, bit.ly shows me all the recent links he makes. bitly explains the network like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Know all those friends of yours on Facebook and the folks you follow on Twitter? Well, if they use bitly, whenever they save a public bitmark, it shows up here!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve since changed my bitly account to be private. It’s <a href="http://bitly.com/a/settings/saving">super easy</a>, but should be private by default.</p>

<h2 id="the-fallout">The Fallout</h2>

<p>Last week, I let Ben know about this hole and he made the appropriate changes to the bitly account which makes newly-created shortened URLs private and disables the +<code class="highlighter-rouge">.rss</code> trick.</p>
