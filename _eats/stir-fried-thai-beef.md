## ingredients

### beef and marinade

- 3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 pounds blade steak, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips

### stir-fry

- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Asian chili-garlic paste
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 serrano chiles or jalape√±o chiles, halved, seeds and ribs removed, chiles cut crosswise 1/8 inch thick
- 3 medium shallots, trimmed of ends, peeled, quartered lengthwise, and layers separated
- 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, large leaves torn into bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1/3 cup chopped unsalted roasted peanuts

## instructions

- For the beef and marinade, Combine coriander, white pepper, brown sugar, and fish sauce in large bowl. Add beef, toss well to combine; marinate 15 minutes.
- If you cannot find blade steaks, use flank steak; because flank steak requires less trimming, you will need only about 1 3/4 pounds. To cut a flank steak into the proper-sized slices for stir-frying, first cut the steak with the grain into 1 1/2-inch strips, then cut the strips against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. White pepper lends this stir-fry a unique flavor; black pepper is not a good substitute. Serve the stir-fry with steamed jasmine rice.
- For the stir-fry, in small bowl, stir together fish sauce, vinegar, water, brown sugar, and chili-garlic paste until sugar dissolves; set aside. In small bowl, mix garlic with 1 teaspoon oil; set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until smoking; add one-third of beef to skillet in even layer. Cook, without stirring, until well browned, about 2 minutes, then stir and continue cooking until beef is browned around edges and no longer pink in the center, about 30 seconds. Transfer beef to medium bowl. Repeat with additional oil and remaining meat in 2 more batches.
- After transferring last batch of beef to bowl, reduce heat to medium; add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to now-empty skillet and swirl to coat. Add chiles and shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Push chile-shallot mixture to sides of skillet to clear center; add garlic to clearing and cook, mashing mixture with spoon, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Stir to combine garlic with chile-shallot mixture. Add fish sauce mixture to skillet; increase heat to high and cook until slightly reduced and thickened, about 30 seconds. Return beef and any accumulated juices to skillet, toss well to combine and coat with sauce, stir in half of mint and cilantro; serve immediately, sprinkling individual servings with portion of peanuts and remaining herbs, and passing lime wedges separately.
