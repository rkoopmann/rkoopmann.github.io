I made another iOS app. This one is a "magic" trick. Actually, it's just process of elimination by restructuring a 2-dimension array. It's the [21 card trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_Card_Trick).

I had learned this one nearly 30 years ago from a friend in middle school.

At any rate, [have at it][app link].
