  description: Crap on it all you want, Linoleum got me into these guys. Their very early stuff is a little too punk for me; their later stuff is a little too fluff for me. White Trash, Punk in Drublic, Heavy Petting Zoo, The Decline, Pump Up The Valuum, Surfer, & 45 or 46 Songs are the goldilocks ones for me.
