    date: 2022-01-04
    artist: Faith No More
    album: Angel Dust
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/angel-dust/184672979
    year: 1992
    notes: I was familiar with a few tracks via the This Is It album that I already enjoy.
  -
    date: 2022-01-04
    artist: Jawbox
    album: For Your Own Special Sweetheart
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-your-own-special-sweetheart/338873219
    year: 1994
    notes: Nothing really. It was music. Mediocre.
  -
    date: 2022-01-04
    artist: Government Issue
    album: Legless Bull
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/legless-bull/54532572
    year: 1981
    notes: Sounds like an early 80s punk album would sound like. Fast tempo, short songs, repeating choruses.
  -
    date: 2022-01-04
    artist: J. Robbins
    album: Un-Becoming
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/un-becoming/1457353109
    year: 2019
    notes: This album sounds like an alt-pop album circa 1996 that I would not have liked in 1996. Fuck the Future, LLC, nice.
  -
    date: 2022-01-11
    artist: Mother Love Bone
    album: Apple
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/apple/1440655529
    year: 1990
    notes: Dripping with late 80s glam rock sounds. It's almost painful to listen to 31 years later. This is how music sounded in the midwest before Nevermind was released about 14 months later (and subsequently broke into the mainstream and changed music). I recently watched the Pearl Jam 20 documentary and I do believe Ed picked the best Mother Love Bone song (at least on this album) to cover.
  -
    date: 2022-01-11
    artist: Pixies
    album: Come On Pilgrim
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/come-on-pilgrim/266192033
    year: 1987
    notes: I hear traces of Surfer Rosa in this one, but not enough.
  -
    date: 2022-01-12
    artist: Scream
    album: Still Screaming
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/still-screaming/784885167
    year: 1993
    notes: A bit too thrashy for me? not enough melodies, i guess?
  -
    date: 2022-01-14
    artist: All
    album: Allroy Sez…
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/allroy-sez/117332958
    year: 1989
    notes: Quite similar to The Descendants (obviously) but still not quite the same.
  -
    date: 2022-01-14
    artist: Faith No More
    album: King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/king-for-a-day-fool-for-a-lifetime/184673815
    year: 1995
    notes: Again, I was already familiar with a couple of these tracks; I vividly recall picking up the [April 1995 _Concrete Corner_ cassette](https://www.discogs.com/release/19273849-Various-Concrete-Music-Bloc-Volume-IV) from Ernie November's in Mankato, MN and almost wearing out Digging the Grave after attending their show the following month.

    album: Samiam
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/samiam/585953464
    year: 1989
    notes: Big fan of Soar & Clumsy. I can certainly hear the seeds of those tunes here.
  -
    date: 2022-01-21
    artist: Veruca Salt
    album: Ghost Notes
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/ghost-notes/992287467
    year: 2015
    notes: It sounds like Veruca Salt's Sea Change album? Lots of break-up lines across many tracks. It's fine; nothing special.
  -
    date: 2022-01-26
    artist: Faces
    album: Ooh La La
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/ooh-la-la/1031010809
    year: 1973
    notes: Nothing terribly catchy prior to the final, title track.
  -
    date: 2022-01-26
    artist: The Beach Boys
    album: Pet Sounds
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/pet-sounds/1440841241
    year: 1966
    notes: _Sloop John B_ is quite catchy. Still, this is not my thing.
  -
    date: 2022-03-02
    artist: CIV
    album: B-Sides and Extras
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/b-sides-and-extras/1603642792
    year: 2009
    notes: "Oof. has a very late 90s feel to the tracks. hits all the As: angst, anger, & aggression."
  -
    date: 2022-03-02
    artist: Corey Taylor
    album: CMFB …Sides
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/cmfb-sides/1607366371
    year: 2022
    notes: Decent metal album. Talented guy, but not really my thing. Enjoyed redo of Shakin', Lunatic Fringe, & On The Dark Side.
  -
    date: 2022-04-11
    artist: The Replacements
    album: Let It Be
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-be/162563989
    year: 1984
    notes: "I had only heard Androgynous from The Crash Test Dummies but then The Flaming Lips played it at a show I recently attended. I figured I should probably listen to something from them. Some songs that I found quaint: Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out, Gary's Got a Boner, & Answering Machine."
  -
    date: 2022-05-09
    artist: The Rolling Stones
    album: "The Rolling Stones Singles Collection: The London Years"
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-rolling-stones-singles-collection-the-london-years/1440759277
    year: 1989
    notes: A nice collection of the songs you already know.
  -
    date: 2022-05-10
    artist: Arcade Fire
    album: WE
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/we/1613566080
    year: 2022
    notes: It was an Arcade Fire album. Nothing terribly exciting; nothing terribly terrible.
  -
    date: 2022-05-13
    artist: Hüsker Dü
    album: Everything Falls Apart
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/everything-falls-apart/1249140194
    year: 1983
    notes: Fresh off listening to Metal Circus, I wanted to hear more, so here we are.
  -
    date: 2022-05-13
    artist: Hüsker Dü
    album: Metal Circus
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/metal-circus/515536188
    year: 1983
    notes: In the early 1990s, I noticed my older sister's boyfriend wore a Hüsker Dü shirt; Based on the umlauts, I assumed they were German, and not band from St. Paul, MN. While reviewing The Replacements - Let It Be, Hüsker Dü came up in the "Similar Artists" section and it occurred to me that I'd never listened to them before. Not bad, not bad.
  -
    date: 2022-05-19
    artist: Fugazi
    album: Repeater & 3 Songs
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/repeater-3-songs/49249888
    year: 1990
    notes: Not my cup of tea.

    album: Twice Shy (Expanded Edition)
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/twice-shy-expanded-edition/1532333446
    year: 1989
    notes: kind of meh 80s glam rock. wasted rock ranger was kind of funny.
  -
    date: 2022-05-24
    artist: Dinosaur Jr.
    album: Green Mind
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/green-mind/1318697584
    year: 1991
    notes: This could be background for a movie that's based in the early 1990s. Very unmemorable.
  -
    date: 2022-06-01
    artist: The Flaming Lips
    album: Telepathic Surgery
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/telepathic-surgery/332172073
    year: 1989
    notes: I love the flaming lips. but somehow i'd never listened to this album despite having added it to my itunes collection back in 2010. Either that or my scrubbling is/was borked. at any rate, a decent, early version of the flaming lips here.
  -
    date: 2022-06-27
    artist: Sonic Youth
    album: Rather Ripped
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/rather-ripped/1443129175
    year: 2006

  -
    date: 2022-06-28

    album: Daydream Nation (Remastered)
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/daydream-nation-remastered/520504308
    year: 1988
    notes: a little less polished than Rather Ripped.
  -
    date: 2022-06-29
    artist: Goldfinger
    album: Never Look Back
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/never-look-back/1539569967
    year: 2020
    notes: It's a Goldfinger album; nothing overly catchy, nothing overly horrible.
  -
    date: 2022-07-07
    artist: Helmet
    album: Betty
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/betty/1440903175
    year: 1994
    notes: Milquetoast was on heavy rotation when this came out and I liked it, but never actually bought the album despite my friends praising it. It's a fine album.
  -
    date: 2022-07-08
    artist: Pixies
    album: Doolittle
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/doolittle/7060469
    year: 1989
    notes: I like _Here comes your man_, so figured i'd try this one as well. And I'm now recognizing the _Monkey gone to heaven_ nod in The Bloodhound Gang's 1996 breakout song _Fire water burn_.
  -

    year: 2007
    notes: I know and enjoy Dance of the Manatee, however, this entire album is not at all good. Thankfully, the songs are only 3 or 4 minutes long.
  -

    album: Welcome to Sky Valley
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-to-sky-valley/207973376

    year: 1995

    artist: Unwritten Law
    album: Oz Factor
    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/oz-factor/192812281
    year: 1996
    notes: apparently i saw them at a bad religion show back in April 1996; I don't remember them at all. i do know _Superman_ from this timeframe. this sounds like mid-to-late 90s poppunk. nothing terribly memorable here.

    url: https://music.apple.com/us/album/doggerel/1626175011
    year: 2022
